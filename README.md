# Hand-tracked cockpit clicking for VR flight simulators

This project is an OpenXR API layer aimed to make it easy to click on cockpits in VR flight simulators.

This is **not** intended to be or usable as general-purpose hand tracking support: it is designed to work well with specific games (DCS and MSFS).
