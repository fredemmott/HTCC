# Sleep/Wake

When DCS World is running, HTCC controls your mouse. This can cause probelms when you are trying to use another program,
or due to DCS's design, while using DCS menus or other 2D UI.

To temporarily disable HTCC, hold your hand still near the top of your field of view until you hear beeps; to re-enable
HTCC, repeat until you hear beeps in the opposite order.

You can disable this feature in the HTCC settings app.

This feature is only available when using OpenXR Hand Tracking.
