## Getting Help

**This is an experiment**; you should only use this if you're already comfortable with OpenComposite and other required projects, I have very limited time to support.

I make this for my own use, and I share this in the hope others find it useful; I'm not able to commit to support, bug fixes, or feature development.

First, check the documentation links above; if you still need help, support may be available from the community via the #help channel in [my Discord]. I am not able to respond to 1:1 requests for help via any means, including GitHub, Discord, Twitter, Reddit, or email.
