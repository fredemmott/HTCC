# MSFS

No special setup needed; just be sure to follow the setup instructions for your hardware before installing Hand Tracked Cockpit Clicking:

- [Oculus Hand Tracking](../oculus-hand-tracking/README.md)
- [PointCTRL](../../hardware/pointctrl/README.md)

## Controls

Touchscreen/mouse emulation is not supported for MSFS.

- 'left click'/index finger pinch: vr controller trigger (primary interaction)
- 'right click'/middle finger pinch: push the vr controller away (push button)
- 'scroll up'/ring finger pinch: scroll wheel up (decrease value)
- 'scroll down'/little finger pinch: scroll wheel down (decrease value)

Movement will not be tracked for a few seconds after using scroll wheel up/down; this is a limitation of MSFS.
