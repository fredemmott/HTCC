# PointCTRL v2

Requirements:
- you must be comfortable updating the firmware
- you must have a PointCTRL v2, not v1

**WARNING:** After installing the custom firmware, the PointCTRL will *only* work as a joystick, not as a mouse/touchscreen - you will not be able to use it without this project unless you restore the standard firmware.

1. Download [the latest standard firmware and firmware update tools](https://pointctrl.com/firmware/)
2. Unzip it
3. Make a backup copy of `PointCTRL_Update_Data\firmware.hex` - this is the standard firmware that you will need to restore if you want the original PointCTRL functionality
4. Replace that file with the latest firmware file from [GitHub Releases] or the #hand-tracking channel in [my Discord], renaming it to `firmware.hex`
5. Follow PointCTRL's instructions for updating the firmware; if you need help, ask in the [PointCTRL Discord]
