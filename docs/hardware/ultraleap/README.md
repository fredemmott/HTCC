# Ultraleap

1. Make sure you have Gemini v5.16.0 (October 2023) or later installed
2. Set 'Hand tracking device' to 'OpenXR hand tracking'
3. *Optional*: enable pinch gestures
4. For v5.16.0, under 'Workarounds':
   - Turn on 'Ignore XR_FB_hand_tracking_aim_pose'
   - Turn on 'Force-enable XR_EXT_hand_tracking'
   - Turn on 'Force-enable XR_FB_hand_tracking_aim'

## DCS

You must use the multithreaded version of DCS, and remove the `LeapC.dll` from **both** the `bin` and `bin-mt` folders inside your DCS installation. Alternatively, rename them to `LeapC.dll.bak`.

You may need to repeat these steps after any DCS update or repair.

## Adjusting the position

See [Ultraleap's documentation](https://docs.ultraleap.com/openxr/configuration/index.html#configuration-file), and contact Ultraleap support if you need assistance.

### Pimax's hand tracking module

This should show up in Ultraleap's software as a "Stereo IR 170", and your hands likely appear ~ 10-15cm too high; this can be fixed by following Ultraleap's documentation above; you should start with a tilt angle of 25 degrees, e.g:

```JSON
{
  "pos": [0, 0, 0],
  "tilt_angle": 25
}```

You can also [download this `api_layer_config.json`](pimax/api_layer_config.json); follow Ultraleap's documentation, create `%PROGRAMDATA%\Ultraleap\OpenXR` if necessary (this is *usually* equivalent to `C:\ProgramData\Ultraleap\OpenXR\api_layer_config.json`), and put the .json file there. **If you need assistance, contact Ultraleap support.**

## Troubleshooting

- Run [`OpenXR-API-Layers-Win64-HKLM.exe`](https://github.com/fredemmott/OpenXR-API-Layers-GUI/releases/latest) - download the zip linked in the description there.
- make sure that the Ultraleap layer is after HTCC; the 'Fix it!' buttons should do this
- you probably want to fix any other issues the tool finds
- if the game fails to start in VR with the 'Force-enable' options on, **you need to contact Ultraleap support** - the Ultraleap driver is not working correctly.
